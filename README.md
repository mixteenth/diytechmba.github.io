# DIY Tech MBA

![Bookshelf](img/bookshelf.jpg)

## Introduction

I reached a point in my career a few years ago where I wished I *had* an MBA, but it was difficult to *get* an MBA. It would be hard to stop working and get one, hard and expensive to find the time to do a part-time one, and I wasn't working for a place that would pay for one at the time. 

I don't need the structure of an MBA program to provide motivation, and I'm not afraid to read. So I decided instead to just focus my reading practice towards an MBA curriculum. 

My focus was on a *Tech* MBA which to me means learning about how to start, grow, and manage technology companies. The curriculum would need all the typical core classes, but electives that focus on technology leadership.

My research found all sorts of great sources for ideas:

- The assigned books of the top traditional MBA programs, and more tech-focused programs such as the [Stern Tech MBA](http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/tech-mba/program), [Cornell Tech MBA](https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/johnson-cornell-tech-mba), [MIT Sloan](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/) (*cool, they used a [blog post](https://blog.davidtate.org/clear-and-present-leadership/) of mine in a [weekly link roundup](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/best-of-this-week-creative-culture-interviews/)*), and [CMU's Masters of Product Management](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/master-science-product-management
).
- [Personal MBA book and reading list](https://personalmba.com/).
- [Seth Godin's altMBA](https://altmba.com/) [unofficial book list](https://www.goodreads.com/shelf/show/altmba).
- [Basecamp MBA list](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the--basecamp-mba--reading-list/)
- My own judgement.
